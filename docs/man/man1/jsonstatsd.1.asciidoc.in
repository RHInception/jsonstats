NAME
----
jsonstatsd - RESTful interface for querying arbitrary system facts



SYNOPSIS
--------
jsonstatsd [-h] [-p PORT] [-l INTERFACE] [--logdir DIR]



DESCRIPTION
-----------

*jsonstats* is a pluggable system which provides a RESTful interface
to query a machine for any arbitrary information about
it. *jsonstatsd* is the name of the command to run this service. The
results returned are provided by 'Fact Plugins' in JSON format.



OPTIONS
-------
*-h*, *--help*::

Show a help message and exit.

*-p PORT*, *--port PORT*::

Specify the *PORT* to listen on. Default: '8008'

*-l INTERFACE*, *--listen INTERFACE*::

Specify the *INTERFACE* to listen on. Default: '0.0.0.0'
+
Give *127.0.0.1* to only listen for local requests.

*--logdir DIRECTORY*::

The *DIRECTORY* to store application logs in. Default: './logs/'


EXAMPLE
-------
Fetch the data

    $ curl localhost:8008


If you run this command, you'll see that the output from *jsonstats*
can be rather difficult to read in raw form. On systems with Python
2.5+ you can pipe the output into the json reformatter instead:

    $ curl localhost:8008 | python -m json.tool
    {
        "facter": {
            "architecture": "x86_64",
            "augeasversion": "1.0.0",
            "facterversion": "1.6.18",
            "lsbdistid": "Fedora"
            ...
        },
        "rpm": {
            "ehcache-core": "2.6.0",
            "eject": "2.1.5",
            "elfutils-libs": "0.154",
            "elinks": "0.12",
            "emacs": "24.1",
            "emacs-apel": "10.8",
            "emacs-auto-complete": "1.3.1",
            "emacs-bbdb": "2.35",
            "emacs-color-theme": "6.6.0",
            "emacs-common": "24.1",
            "emacs-common-w3m": "1.4.435",
            "jsonstats": "%VERSION%",
            "talook": "1.2.09
            ...
        }
    }

There are several other tools which can do this for you as
well. Search for *"bash json format"* online and you should be able to
find what you need.
